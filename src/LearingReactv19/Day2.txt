✅ React components group rendering logic together with markup because they are related.
✅ JSX is similar to HTML, with a few differences. You can use a converter if you need to.
✅ Error messages will often point you in the right direction to fixing your markup.


✅ Now you know almost everything about JSX:
✅ JSX attributes inside quotes are passed as strings.
✅ Curly braces let you bring JavaScript logic and variables into your markup.
✅ They work inside the JSX tag content or immediately after = in attributes.
✅ {{ and }} is not special syntax: it’s a JavaScript object tucked inside JSX curly braces
