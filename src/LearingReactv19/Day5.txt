✅ **Trees are a common way to represent the relationship between entities. They are often used to model UI.**  
✅ **Render trees represent the nested relationship between React components across a single render.**  
✅ **With conditional rendering, the render tree may change across different renders. With different prop values, components may render different children components.**  
✅ **Render trees help identify what the top-level and leaf components are. Top-level components affect the rendering performance of all components beneath them, and leaf components are often re-rendered frequently. Identifying them is useful for understanding and debugging rendering performance.**  
✅ **Dependency trees represent the module dependencies in a React app.**  
✅ **Dependency trees are used by build tools to bundle the necessary code to ship an app.**  
✅ **Dependency trees are useful for debugging large bundle sizes that slow time to paint and expose opportunities for optimizing what code is bundled.**
